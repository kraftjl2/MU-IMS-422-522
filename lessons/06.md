### Review Lesson 5 Homework

We'll quickly run through what we learned last week and discuss any questions or issues.

### Dinner Dash IV

- Write custom vaildation on order model from last week
- Discuss seed data
  - Add items, categories, users
- Allow admins to make other users admins (remove attr_accessible)
- Discuss before filters and requiring authorization
- Discuss sessions, and implement a cart

### Homework

- Ensure only admins can access administration screens
  - ItemsController: index, new, edit, create, update, destroy
  - CategoriesController: index, new, edit, create, update, destroy
  - UsersController: index, destroy (Additionally, a signed-in user can only edit/update their own user record)
  - OrdersController: index, edit, update, destroy (Additionally, a user must be signed-in to access new/create)
- Hide navigation items inaccessible to non-administrators
- Allow users to remove items from their cart
