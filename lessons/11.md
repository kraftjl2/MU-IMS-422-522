### Review Lesson 10 Homework

We'll quickly run through what we learned last week and discuss any questions or issues.

### Dinner Dash IX

- Discuss our mailer bug from last week
- Discuss concerns as a way to extract shared logic

### Homework

Administrators may put items on sale. They can:

- Create a "sale" and connect it with individual items
- Sales are created as a percentage off the normal price
- View a list of all active sales
- End a sale

On the order "dashboard" they can:

- View details of an individual order, including:
  - If purchased on sale, original price, and adjusted price
  - Subtotal for the order
  - Discount for the order
  - Total for the order reflecting any discounts from applicable sales

As an Unauthenticated User:
