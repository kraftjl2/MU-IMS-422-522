### Review Lesson 7 Homework

We'll quickly run through what we learned last week and discuss any questions or issues.

### Dinner Dash VII

- Discuss testing in rails

### Homework

You canâ€™t order food and just pick it up immediately. Determine the earliest pickup time possible when an order is submitted:

- Each item in the store has a preparation time, defaulting to 12 minutes. Items can be edited to take longer.
- The kitchen can prepare only one item at a time.
- If an order has more than six items, add 10 minutes for every additional six items.
- Each already "paid" order in the system which is not "complete" delays the production start of this new order by 4 minutes.

When a customer is placing an order, they can select a date/time for pickup as long as it is...

- In the future
- No sooner than the "predicted" pickup time
- On a day/time combo when the restaurant is open (the restaurant should be closed at least 60 hours per week)
