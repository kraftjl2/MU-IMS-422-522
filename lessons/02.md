### Review Lesson 1 Homework

We'll quickly run through what we learned last week and discuss any questions or issues.

### Ruby Methods, Classes & Nothingness

Today's lecture is based on [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html) from Jumpstart Lab. Some of it is redundant based on our work with Codecademy, but we'll skip over those parts.
