### Review Lesson 3 Homework

We'll quickly run through what we learned last week and discuss any questions or issues.

### Dinner Dash II

- We'll learn about associations by adding categories to items
- We'll create a few controllers and routes by hand, rather than just using the `rails generate scaffold` command

### Homework

- Create the photo field for those who didn't get around to it last week
- Create a controller for marketing pages of the site
- Add a home, about and FAQ page to the marketing controller

*Create Categories*

- Items should `belong_to` a category
- The category should be listed on the items show action
- Users should be able to view items by category
